# Affero GNU Public License 3.0

**All code under kdcloud is license under AGPL 3.0.**

The Affero GPL license is a basic variation over the GPL that also covers web users: You must also provide the source code of your program if its accessed through a network, not only direct users.

This means that if you decide to use kdcloud for your project for the Internet, you must allow users to download the source code to all Internet users. This is a logical extension of the GPL to be used on the Web.

The full license text is at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html, if you have any doubt, please read the full text to ensure your software will comply.
